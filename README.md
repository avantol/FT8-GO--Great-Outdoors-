What is FT8-GO?
===============
FT8-GO creates a single-purpose laptop with optimized FT8 operation and helpful additions for portable amateur radio operations "in the field". 

It's perfect for re-purposing ancient laptops (up to about 12 years old). You can use a laptop that's otherwise completely unusable because of the processing demands of current operating systems and recent FT8 versions.

When you get ready to go to the "Great Outdoors" for FT8, leave your expensive new laptop at home... an old laptop does the job just fine.

- One-click upload to Logbook of the World, one-click downloading current QSOs before operating.

- Easy 'Parks on the Air' (POTA) operation and one-click ADIF log generation, ready for upload using the POTA web site.

- Assisted 'Field Day' operation and one-click Cabrillo log generation, ready for upload to ARRL.

- Convenient features for any type of FT8 activity, including selectable message protocol, responding to specific CQs (directed. local, DX). 

- Manual, semi-automatic, or full automatic QSOs, choose what suits you from minute to minute.

- You can grab any FT8-GO laptop before you head out for field operation: Take the one with the best battery charge, best USB ports, best screen, best wifi, etc. .... and get your current "worked-before" status downloaded with one click.
