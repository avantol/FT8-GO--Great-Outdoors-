Create a Linux Lite 3.4 32-bit installer on a USB flash drive.
The ISO file is available at:
https://repo.linuxliteos.com/linuxlite/isos/3.4/linux-lite-3.4-32bit.iso

- Use only the Rufus image creator, it leaves the flash drive
  writeable for thr next step. Rufus 3.4 is known to work.
- Select 'FAT32' filesystem
- The flash drive volume name MUST be: WSJTX

Copy the files (except two source code files) at the FT8-GO release page:
https://github.com/avantol/FT8-GO--Great-Outdoors-/releases/latest
to the flash drive in the root folder.

Note: *ONLY* this distribution and version of Linux
shown above is known to work correctly for FT8-GO!

Reason: FT8-GO is designed especifically for using
low-spec processors (to re-purpose otherwise useless
laptops for portable amateur radio operation).

The minimum processor is an Atom N450, which has
a published Passmark benchmark score of 235.

The QSO timing in FT8-GO will not be satisfactory using
any processor with a lower benchmark score. QSO messages
will be heavily backlogged, and QSOs will not
proceed as expected.
