Copy the contents of the folder "FT8-GO_USB"
to a USB stick containing the Linux Lite 3.4 32-bit
installer, available at:
https://repo.linuxliteos.com/linuxlite/isos/3.4/linux-lite-3.4-32bit.iso

Note: *ONLY* this distribution and version of Linux
is known to work for FT8-GO!

Reason: FT8-GO is designed especifically for using
low-spec processors (to re-purpose otherwise useless
laptops for portable amateur radio operation).

The minimum processor is an Atom N450, which has
a published Passmark benchmark score of 235.

The QSO timing in FT8-GO will not be satisfactory using
any processor with a lower benchmark score. QSO messages
will be heavily backlogged, and QSOs will not
proceed as expected.
